# LiDAR-LLM
## Model Release

We are releasing our `model.py` file, which includes nearly all the methods discussed in our paper. The data pipeline relies heavily on **[BEV Fusion](https://github.com/ADLab-AutoDrive/BEVFusion)** and **[Llama Adapter](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter)**. As for the datasets, we have recently cleaned the data and plan to release part of it within the month.

## To-Do List:
- [x] Release the `model.py` file containing all the methods.
- [ ] Release the pipeline code.
- [ ] Release some datasets.
